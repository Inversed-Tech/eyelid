//! The implementation of a modular polynomial, [`Poly`].
//!
//! This module contains fundamental operations which ensure that the polynomial is always in its canonical form.
//! They should be called after every operation that can create non-canonical polynomials, which can happen when:
//! - the leading coefficient is set to zero, including when the polynomial is split or truncated, or
//! - the degree of the polynomial is increased, for example, during multiplication.

// Optional TODOs:
// - re-implement IndexMut manually, to enforce the canonical form (highest coefficient is non-zero) and modular arithmetic
//   (this can be done by returning a new type with `DerefMut<Target = Coeff>``, but it could have performance impacts)
// Trivial:
// - implement Sum manually
